# To do app 

This application has been made using the Java FX libraries and serves as an example of using those libraries to make a simple UI with which a client can interact.  
The recommended practice when creating JavaFX apps is to follow the MVC(Model View Controller) design pattern, and in this project you can see an example of it.

### Usage

Run the Main.java class, upon startup user interface will be displayed.

The titles of the tasks are on the left hand side and clicking on them will show the task details as well as due date on the right side of the UI.

#### Adding tasks 
Tasks can be added using the File -> New...  
Or by pressing the new icon below the menu.

#### Deleting tasks
Tasks are deleted by right-clicking on them and selecting the delete option which gets shown in a drop down menu, a pop-up menu will appear asking you to confirm deletion.

#### Filtering tasks
Tasks can also be filtered, and for the example filted i've added the option to filter the tasks that are due today. 

### Color legend

Red - tasks with overdue deadline  
Blue - tasks that are due today  
Black(default) - all other tasks  

### Thank you!

Thank you for checking out my project.  
If you would like to see a little bit more complex JavaFX application take at look at my [Playlist Maker 9001](https://github.com/StefanOffice/stefs-playlist-maker-9001) :wink:
